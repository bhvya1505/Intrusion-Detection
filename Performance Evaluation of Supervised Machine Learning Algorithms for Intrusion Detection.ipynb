    "## About the NSL-KDD dataset\n",
    "Have you ever wondered how your computer/network is able to avoid being infected with malware and bad traffic inputs from the internet? The reason why it can detect it so well is because there are systems in place to protect your valuable information held in your computer or networks. These systems that detect malicious traffic inputs are called Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and are trained on internet traffic record data. The most common data set is the NSL-KDD, and is the benchmark for modern-day internet traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "The NSL-KDD data set has the following advantages over the original KDD data set:\n",
    "- It does not include redundant records in the train set, so the classifiers will not be biased towards more frequent records.\n",
    "- There is no duplicate records in the proposed test sets; therefore, the performance of the learners are not biased by the methods which have better detection rates on the frequent records.\n",
    "- The number of selected records from each difficultylevel group is inversely proportional to the percentage of records in the original KDD data set. As a result, the classification rates of distinct machine learning methods vary in a wider range, which makes it more efficient to have an accurate evaluation of different learning techniques.\n",
    "- The number of records in the train and test sets are reasonable, which makes it affordable to run the experiments on the complete set without the need to randomly select a small portion. Consequently, evaluation results of different research works will be consistent and comparable.\n",

    "These data sets contain the records of the internet traffic seen by a simple intrusion detection network and are the ghosts of the traffic encountered by a real IDS and just the traces of its existence remains. The data set contains 43 features per record, with 41 of the features referring to the traffic input itself and the last two are labels (whether it is a normal or attack) and Score (the severity of the traffic input itself).\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the data set exists 4 different classes of attacks: Denial of Service (DoS), Probe, User to Root(U2R), and Remote to Local (R2L). A brief description of each attack can be seen below:\n",
    "1. DoS is an attack that tries to shut down traffic flow to and from the target system. The IDS is flooded with an abnormal amount of traffic, which the system can’t handle, and shuts down to protect itself. This prevents normal traffic from visiting a network. An example of this could be an online retailer getting flooded with online orders on a day with a big sale, and because the network can’t handle all the requests, it will shut down preventing paying customers to purchase anything. This is the most common attack in the data set.\n",
    "2. Probe or surveillance is an attack that tries to get information from a network. The goal here is to act like a thief and steal important information, whether it be personal information about clients or banking information.\n",
    "3. U2R is an attack that starts off with a normal user account and tries to gain access to the system or network, as a super-user (root). The attacker attempts to exploit the vulnerabilities in a system to gain root privileges/access.\n",
    "4. R2L is an attack that tries to gain local access to a remote machine. An attacker does not have local access to the system/network, and tries to “hack” their way into the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is noticed from the descriptions above that DoS acts differently from the other three attacks, where DoS attempts to shut down a system to stop traffic flow altogether, whereas the other three attempts to quietly infiltrate the system undetected."
